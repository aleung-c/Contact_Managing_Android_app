# Contact_Managing_Android_app

The goal of this project is to create an android application to manage contact, as would the android regular contact manager. In this application, the user can create, edit and delete contacts, in a separate database from the shared contacts database. The point was to learn as much as possible in android development, ranging from simple XML layouting to creation of systems inside the Android environment. The hard part was to understand and handle the whole android API, and make a coherent program from it.
